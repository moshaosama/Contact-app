# Project Name

This is my first project using Java and Spring Boot! I am excited to share this as Iâ€™ve successfully built the backend and integrated it with React.

## Description

This project is a contact management system where you can add, edit, and delete contacts.

## Features

- **Add new Contact**: Endpoint to add a new contact to the system.
- **Edit Contact**: Endpoint to modify the details of an existing contact.
- **Delete Contact**: Endpoint to remove a contact from the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: (specify if you're using a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repo-link>`
2. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd <backend-directory>`
3. Run the Spring Boot application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
4. Ensure the backend is running on the specified port (usually `localhost:8080`).

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd <frontend-directory>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the React app: `npm start`

## Endpoints
